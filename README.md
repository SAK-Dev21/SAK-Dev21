# Ello, Iâ€™m Sahil ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Software Engineering student who enjoys creating software thatâ€™s useful, meaningful, and occasionally ridiculous - using Python, web technologies, and data tools.

Iâ€™ve worked on projects involving data science, web development, and system design, and Iâ€™ve often been the one carrying the team when needed.

Right now, Iâ€™m looking for a role where I can gain experience as deep as the Pacific Ocean, solve real world problems, and grow into a more capable developer.

Iâ€™m open to backend, front-end, full-stack, or data-focused roles. Anything that challenges me and lets me contribute meaningfully.

> Iâ€™m not the most experienced developer yet - but Iâ€™m relentless, self-aware, and I wonâ€™t build anything I wouldnâ€™t stand behind.
