# Ello, I’m Sahil 👋

I’m a Software Engineering student who enjoys creating software that’s useful, meaningful, and occasionally ridiculous - using Python, web technologies, and data tools.

I’ve worked on a variety of projects involving data science and web development.

Right now, I’m looking for a role where I can gain experience as deep as the Pacific Ocean, solve real world problems, and grow into a more capable developer.

I’m open to backend, front-end or full-stack roles. Anything that challenges me and lets me contribute meaningfully.

> I’m not the most experienced developer yet - but I’m relentless, self-aware, and I won’t build anything I wouldn’t stand behind.
